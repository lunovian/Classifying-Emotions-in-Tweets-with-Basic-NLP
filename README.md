# Emotion-Topic Correlation Analysis on Twitter Data ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¬

This project explores the relationship between emotions and topics in Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By employing sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, it aims to uncover key themes associated with different emotions expressed on social media.

### Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text data for analysis.
- **Emotion Classification**: Map raw labels to emotions (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anger).
- **Topic Modeling with LDA**: Extract meaningful topics associated with each emotion using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
- **Multithreading for Efficiency**: Speed up topic extraction by processing emotions in parallel.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive heatmaps created with Plotly to visualize emotion-topic correlations.

### Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **NLTK**: Text preprocessing and stopwords
- **scikit-learn**: CountVectorizer and LDA for topic modeling
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **pandas & Dask**: Data manipulation and large-scale processing

### Use Cases
- Social media sentiment monitoring
- Mental health research through social data
- Customer feedback analysis

### Getting Started
